      {
        "heading": "Transitive vs. Intransitive Verbs",
        "content": "<strong>Transitive verbs</strong> require a direct object to complete their meaning—they transfer action to something or someone. <strong>Intransitive verbs</strong> express complete actions or states without needing an object. Many verbs can function as both depending on context.",
        "example": "Transitive: 'She reads <em>mystery novels</em> every weekend' (what does she read?). Intransitive: 'She reads constantly' (complete meaning without an object). Note: Some verbs like 'arrive' or 'sleep' are always intransitive."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Action vs. State Verbs",
        "content": "<strong>Action verbs</strong> (dynamic verbs) describe activities or events that happen: run, write, cook, discuss. <strong>State verbs</strong> (stative verbs) describe conditions, emotions, thoughts, or states of being: know, believe, own, seem. State verbs typically don't appear in progressive forms.",
        "example": "Action: 'I'm cooking dinner right now' (can use -ing). State: 'I know the answer' (not 'I'm knowing'). However, some verbs shift meaning: 'I'm having dinner' (action) vs. 'I have two sisters' (state)."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Auxiliary Verbs",
        "content": "<strong>Auxiliary verbs</strong> (helping verbs) work with main verbs to express tense, mood, or voice. The primary auxiliaries are <em>be</em>, <em>have</em>, and <em>do</em>. Modal auxiliaries (will, can, should, must, etc.) express necessity, possibility, or permission.",
        "example": "Primary: 'She <em>is</em> studying' (be + present participle), 'They <em>have</em> finished' (have + past participle), '<em>Do</em> you understand?' (do for questions). Modal: 'You <em>should</em> try this restaurant' (advice)."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Copulative Verbs (Linking Verbs)",
        "content": "<strong>Copulative verbs</strong> connect the subject to additional information about the subject (a complement), rather than showing action. The most common is <em>be</em>, but others include <em>seem</em>, <em>become</em>, <em>appear</em>, <em>feel</em>, <em>taste</em>, <em>smell</em>, <em>sound</em>, and <em>remain</em>.",
        "example": "'She <em>is</em> a teacher' (links subject to noun). 'The soup <em>tastes</em> delicious' (links subject to adjective). 'He <em>became</em> nervous before the presentation' (links subject to state). Note: Some of these verbs can also be action verbs: 'She <em>tasted</em> the soup' (action)."
