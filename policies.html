    <!-- Attendance Policy -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Attendance & Participation</h2>
      <p>Success in language learning comes from consistent small investments of time rather than cramming. This course is designed to get you actively participating in your learning process.</p>
      
      <h3>Earning Participation Points</h3>
      <table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <tr style="border-bottom: 2px solid var(--border);">
          <th style="text-align: left; padding: 0.75rem; font-family: 'Archivo', sans-serif;">Participation Level</th>
          <th style="text-align: right; padding: 0.75rem; font-family: 'Archivo', sans-serif;">Points</th>

        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Making Up Missed Classes</h3>
      <p>If you miss class and your absence is justified, you can make up class periods by showing evidence of completing the contents we covered during that meeting. Absences are justified in cases of medical or family emergencies.</p>
      
      <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Note:</strong> You need to attend at least 30 class meetings. If you attend more than 30 classes, you have the potential to earn extra credit (up to 2 points).</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Late Work Policy -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Late Assignment Policy</h2>
      <p>Late assignments are generally not accepted. The consistent weekly rhythm of this course is designed to support language acquisition through regular practice.</p>
      
      <h3>Exceptions</h3>
      <p>If you've had justified absences or have arranged accommodations in advance with the instructor, you may submit a limited number of late assignments.</p>
      
      <h3>Late Submission Guidelines</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Assignments submitted late must be within a time frame approved by the instructor</li>
        <li><strong>General assignments:</strong> Not accepted without prior arrangement</li>
        <li><strong>Partial exams:</strong> Lose 20% of total available points per day late</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; padding: 1rem; background: var(--bg); border-left: 3px solid var(--error); font-style: italic;">Chronic lateness without justification will not be accommodated in this class.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Group Work Policy -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Group Work Policy</h2>
      <p>Group work is an essential component of this course, appearing in class meetings, peer reviews, and the group projects you'll complete for partial examinations.</p>
      
      <h3>Group Work Expectations</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Attend all group meetings and contribute meaningfully to your team's work</li>
        <li>Contribute equitably to all group assignments and deliverables</li>
        <li>Communicate actively with team members about progress and challenges</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Consequences for Non-Participation</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Taking credit for work you did not contribute to is not tolerated in this class</li>
        <li>Failure to contribute to a group assignment results in 0 points for that assignment</li>
        <li>Repeatedly missing group meetings without valid justification will result in removal from the group</li>
        <li>Repeated offenses may result in failing the class</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- AI Usage Policy -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>AI Usage Policy</h2>
      <p>This course encourages thoughtful integration of AI tools as part of your learning process, particularly for enhancing your understanding of advanced English concepts and refining your language production.</p>
      
      <div style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff3e0 0%, #ffe0b2 100%); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent);">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--primary);">Core Principle</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>First develop your own thoughts, then enhance with AI.</strong> Being able to form your own analysis and expression without AI influence, then strengthen it through AI assistance, is a crucial professional skill. Early AI consultation can prevent you from developing independent analytical and linguistic thinking.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Approved AI Usage</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>After initial drafting:</strong> Use AI to refine, expand, or improve your work after you have established your own foundation</li>
        <li><strong>For understanding concepts:</strong> Use AI to clarify grammar rules, explore register differences, or understand complex structures</li>
        <li><strong>For style enhancement:</strong> Use AI to suggest alternatives or improvements to your original writing</li>
        <li><strong>For practice:</strong> Generate additional examples or exercises to deepen your understanding</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Important Guidelines</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Complete your initial draft and thinking independently before consulting AI</li>
        <li>Always maintain your authentic voice and perspective in final submissions</li>
        <li>Review AI-generated content carefully and make it your own—don't submit content that includes AI prompting language like "let me help you with that" or addresses you from the AI's perspective</li>
        <li>For most activities, answers are provided for self-checking, making AI unnecessary</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What This Looks Like in Practice</h3>
      <p><strong>For writing assignments:</strong> Write your first draft without AI assistance. Then you might use AI to check for grammar errors, suggest stronger word choices, or help you understand why a particular construction works better. Always review these suggestions critically and ensure the final work reflects your own understanding and voice.</p>
      
      <p><strong>For analyzing texts:</strong> Form your own observations and analysis first. You might then use AI to confirm your understanding of grammatical structures or to explore alternative interpretations.</p>

      <div style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1.25rem; background: var(--bg); border-left: 3px solid var(--primary-light);">
        <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Important Reality Check:</strong> It's genuinely difficult to be disciplined about using AI as a tool rather than completely outsourcing your thinking. For your own benefit and language development, you should be actively engaging with course materials and developing your own analytical skills. The goal is to become a more capable English user, which requires your active mental engagement—AI can't do this work for you.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Extra Credit -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Extra Credit Policy</h2>
      <p>Extra credit is designed to reward exceptional effort and consistency, not to replace missed regular coursework. Students who consistently attend and complete assignments should not need extra credit to succeed.</p>
      
      <h3>Extra Credit Opportunities</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Attendance Bonus:</strong> Up to 2 points for attending more than the required 30 class meetings</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Quiz:</strong> 1 point available for completing an additional comprehensive quiz in week 16 (requires only screenshot submission, no reflection)</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Assignment:</strong> 2 points available for completing an 11th assignment with peer review</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Extra Credit Limitations</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Maximum 5 points total (5% of final grade)</li>
        <li>Cannot exceed 100% in the course</li>
        <li>Extra credit cannot substitute for consistently missed regular work</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Academic Integrity -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
      <p>In this course you must submit original work. This means that, while you can and should cite your sources, the work must reflect your own analysis and perspective. For many assignments, the use of generative AI is permitted following the AI usage guidelines above.</p>
      
      <h3>What Constitutes Plagiarism</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Copying work from other students</li>
        <li>Using online resources without proper citation</li>
        <li>Submitting AI-generated work that does not reflect your own understanding or voice</li>
        <li>Taking credit for group work you did not contribute to</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="margin: 1.5rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: #fce4e4; border-left: 4px solid var(--error);">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: var(--error);">Plagiarism Consequences</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Plagiarism of work from other students or online resources, as well as submission of non-original work, will result in a zero grade on the assignment and will be escalated as necessary, with potential additional consequences.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Success Tips -->
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Plan for 2-4 hours of weekly work outside of class.</strong> Generally you will have one quiz and one assignment to complete per week.</li>
        <li><strong>Review materials before classes</strong> to participate effectively and get the most from our time together.</li>
        <li><strong>Start assignments early</strong> to have time to resolve questions and produce your best work.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow the 30-minute rule:</strong> First research independently, then consult with classmates. If after 30 minutes you don't find a solution, contact the instructor.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate proactively</strong> if you're facing challenges with coursework or group members.</li>
        <li><strong>Take advantage of peer review</strong> as a learning opportunity, both when giving and receiving feedback.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Communication Expectations</h3>
      <p>The professor responds to messages during class hours. Do not expect a response outside of class hours. Plan accordingly when working on assignments.</p>
